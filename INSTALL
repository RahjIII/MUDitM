Requires libglib2.0-dev, ctags, openssl, libpcre2

To build type `make`.
To build self-signed keys for local use or testing, type `make cert`.

Has only a very basic 'install' method in the makefile.

There is no init time launch method implemented.  Author runs muditm from the
same guardian script used to keep the MUD running, which is not included here.
A systemd, sysvinit, etc. type init script would be a welcome addition to the
project!

Edit the muditm.conf config file per the comments in the file.

Run `muditm -c ./muditm.conf`
